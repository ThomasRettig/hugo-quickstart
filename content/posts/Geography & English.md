What a day. After my Geography and English exams, I can only say that I am tired. While the English comprehension was rather simple, at least for me, I struggled quite a bit in the Geography test. Some of the questions I found particularly onerous were:

- Explain how the Singaporean government intends to lower the average household water usage _per capita_ from 160 litres to 130 litres by 2030
- Explain how the mangrove plants are more effective at carbon storage as compared to tropical rainforests
- Compare the diversity and density of tropical rainforests and mangroves

The only thing I can do now is to pray fervently that I will still do well. An A+? Out of the question, definitely. But it is not the time to give up.

As for the English exam, our comprehension topic was about jellyfish overpopulation as a result of climate change. I was not too surprised by the topic; climate change was one of the topics that was said to possibly come out. Anyway, I have Chinese and History examinations tomorrow. We shall see how it goes.
